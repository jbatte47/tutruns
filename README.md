# tutruns
Every branch in this repo is a tutorial or article or piece of documentation I'm trying to get through. Public so I can point authors to problems if they come up.

## React Router v6

This one is an examination of the new hooks, in an effort to understand what has changed more fully.

```sh
# clone just this branch so you don't get my whole repo full of weird stuff
git clone -b react-router-v6 --single-branch git@github:jbatte47/tutruns

# head to the app, install dependencies, and start the react dev server
cd tutruns/react-router-test-app
yarn
yarn start
```
